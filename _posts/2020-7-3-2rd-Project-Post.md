## Outline
This project includes three parts, the first part is an introduction, which response to describing the JSON and discussing the possible packages/functions that are available for reading JSON data into R. This part also contains the introduction of NHL and NHL Data. To study the NHL data, I get the 5 JSON data sets from API. And reorganize those data sets by selecting some variables, creating some variables, and combining relevant data sets. 

The second part is the processes of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). In this project, I picked out the "best" franchise and the "worst" franchise according to the EDA part for teamtotalData and seasonData. Then I also tried EDA on the differences between the "best" franchise and the "worst" franchise from goalieData and skaterData. 

The last part is the conclusion from the above analyses, which shows the "best" franchise is Golden Knights (ID: 38) and the "worst" franchise is Coyotes (ID: 28), which might because of the number of goalie and skater, the goalies' ability of resistance and the skaters' aggressive assists.
