# What are your thoughts on R vs whatever other software you've used?  
I study SAS in ST555 and ST556, sometimes I would compare the SAS language and R language, which helps me to better understand these two languages. For example, the variable inside the R function is like the local variable in SAS macro function, which helps me to understand we cannot use the local variable outside. 

# What functionality do you like about R?  
I like the way of R function to use the variable inside R function by using "<<-", which is more flexible than the SAS.

# What parts do you miss about your other language?  
I missed the proc reg and proc glm in SAS because if you set your model done, it would automatically give you pretty plots and tables. 

# Do you consider R a difficult language to learn? (If you knew R prior to the course, describe your experience when first learning it.)
My first time to use R is in the ST501, I do not know we have to install the package and then need the library() or require(), which makes me so frustrated. But when I first use rmd in the homework of ST537, I was shocked by the templates of rmd (like tufte and vignette). And I explored the R shiny part before this course, I find some examples in the gallery are interesting. In my point of view, R is easier than SAS, sometimes you can learn the syntax even from your output, like [] or [[]].
