## Abstract
To study the NHL data, I get the 5 JSON data sets from API. And reorganize those data sets by selecting some variables, creating some variables, and combining relevant data sets. 

In this project, I picked out the "best" franchise and the "worst" franchise according to the EDA part for teamtotalData and seasonData. Then I also tried EDA on the differences between the "best" franchise and the "worst" franchise from goalieData and skaterData. 

The results show that the "best" franchise is Golden Knights (ID: 38) and the "worst" franchise is Coyotes (ID: 28), which might because of the number of goalie and skater, the goalies' ability of resistance and the skaters' aggressive assists.
