## What (if anything) has changed about what you think a data scientist is and what they do?
The machine learning part changed my points of data scientists. When data scientists face a problem, they figure out whether it belongs to supervised learning or unsupervised learning. Besides, they would consider the computing time as well.

## What your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - do you think you'll continue to use R going forward?  Why or why not?
I think R is better for comparing models than SAS, like using AIC or BIC function. Therefore, I would use R to complete the final model selection. And R shiny is a great tool to introduce work, so it might be useful for my job interview.

## What things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?
Since I had this course, I would try to follow the “data science process” which is more approachable; data ingest, data transformation, exploratory data analysis, model selection, model evaluation, etc.
