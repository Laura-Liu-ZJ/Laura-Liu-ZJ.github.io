- What do you think being a data scientist is about?  
I think data scientists are about translating business problems into more of a technical model and being able to then output a model that can take in a certain set of attributes about a customer and then spit out some sort of result. In brief, they bridge programming and statistics, and statistics and products. In essence, however, data scientists still doing statistical work.

- What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?  
Data scientists need to know three parts of knowledge: computer science, mathematics/statistics, and specific domain knowledge
