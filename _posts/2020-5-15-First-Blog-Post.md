### What do you think being a data scientist is about?  
I think data scientists are about translating business problems into more of a technical model and being able to then output a model that can take in a certain set of attributes about a customer and then spit out some sort of result. 
In brief, they bridge programming and statistics, and statistics and products. 
In essence, however, data scientists still doing statistical work.

### What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?  
Data scientists need to know three parts of knowledge: computer science, mathematics/statistics, and specific domain knowledge
#### comupter science: 
| Aspects of computer Science  | Descrption |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Statistical programming   |  Java, Python, SQL, SAS, R, and Scala |
| web services | DigitalOcean, Redshift, S3, and Spark  |
| distributed data and computing tools  | Hadoop, Hive, Gurobi, Map/Reduce, MySQL, and Spark |
| visualizing and presenting data | Business Objects, D3, ggplot, and Periscope |
#### mathematics/statistics: 
| Aspects of mathematics/statistics  | Descrption |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| degree   | Master’s or Ph.D. in computer science, engineering, mathematics, or statistics |
| data mining techniques | boosting, generalized linear models/regression, random forests, trees, and social network analysis |
| machine learning techniques |artificial neural networks, clustering, and decision tree learning |
| extra | the advanced statistical methods and concepts, multiple analytical functions, building statistical models and manipulating data sets|
#### specific domain knowledge: 
1. They need to better understand company needs and devise possible solutions by collaborating with product management and engineering departments.
2. They need to have the ability to work with unstructured data from various sources like video and social media.
3. They need to build processes and tools to help monitor and analyze performance and data accuracy.
4. They need to know how to use predictive modeling to enhance and optimize customer experiences, revenue generation, ad targeting etc.

### What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?  
#### Differences between data scientists and statisticians:
|   | data scientists  | statisticians |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
|modeling processes  |focuses on the predictive accuracy of the model by comparing the predictive accuracy of different machine learning algorithms and selecting the model with the best accuracy  | start with simple model, such as linear regression, where the data is verified to determine whether it is consistent with the assumptions of the model. The model is improved by addressing assumptions in the model that are violated. The modeling process is considered complete when all model assumptions are verified and no assumptions are violated|
| the size of data consumed  | massive  |more traditional and smaller scale methods of data collection |
| the types of problems studied  | solve specific problems by following the “data science process” that is more approachable; data ingest, data transformation, exploratory data analysis, model selection, model evaluation, and data storytelling  | deeply understand academic statistics by dealing with nebulous concepts like point estimates, MOE, CI, SE, p-values, hypothesis testing  |
| the academic background of the people in the field |computer science, engineering, mathematics, or statistics  |statistics |
| terminology   |“example” “feature”  “label”   | “observation” “predictor” or “independent variable” “response”or “dependent variable”|

#### Similarities between data scientists and statisticians:
1. Both data science and statistics aim to extract knowledge from data.
2. Statistics is a crucial component of data science. 
3. Given time, the fields of data science and statistics likely will converge to a common endpoint.

### How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?
I believe that I am more relevant to statisticians now, and the following list shows the condition of myself to data scientists. Those items marked means I not only met the requirements of statisticians I also met that of data scientists. If I want to work as a data scientist in the future, I should establish the connection data scientists indicating by those unmarked items.

- [ ] modeling processes: I start with simple model, such as linear regression, where the data is verified to determine whether it is consistent with the assumptions of the model. 
- [ ] the size of data consumed: I often deal with more traditional and smaller scale methods of data collection.
- [x] the types of problems studyied: I have done the data ingest, data transformation, exploratory data analysis, model selection, and data storytelling, I also deal with nebulous concepts like point estimates, MOE, CI, SE, p-values, hypothesis testing.
- [x] the academic background: I am in the master of statistics program.
- [ ] terminology : I use the “observation”, “predictor” or “independent variable” and “response”or “dependent variable”.
