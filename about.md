### Reflection on ST 558
#### How is the course going so far? 
This course is not too hard for me, and the effects of the online course are out of my expectation.

#### What do you like about the course and what would you change about the course?
I really love the part that tells us how to do all kinds of models we've learned in the prerequisite courses. It helps me to reorganize my knowledge system of statistics. However, some abstract points like API and Parallel Computing, I still do not get along with them very well.

#### Any other thoughts? 
If I learned this course before ST537, I would be more concentrated on the content of ST537 instead of code. Besides, I think teamwork would be better for us to learn about GitHub.
