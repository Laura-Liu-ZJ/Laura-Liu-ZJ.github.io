### Discussion on this project

#### What would you do differently?

- I get data from the internet.
- I use the EDA part to know the data better.
- I create some variables to help my analyses.
- I treat the same variable as categorical data and numeric data.

#### What was the most difficult part for you?

I think the most difficult part for me is to understand the story behind the data because I know nothing on the hokey. It would be better to have a codebook or labels of variables telling me all the information about data.

#### What are your big take-aways from this project?

I know better about JSON data as well as EDA processes, and I master better on ggplot than before.
